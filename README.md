# Personal Portfolio

This repository hosts my personal portfolio, showcasing my **resume**, **projects**, and **contact** information. The UI/UX was initially built using a [tutorial by Cristian Mihai](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dImgZ_AH7uA), and I added TypeScript, functionality and personal styling on top of it.

## Tech Stack
- **Next.js**
- **React**
- **TypeScript**
- **Tailwind CSS**
- **Framer Motion**

### Prerequisites
- **Node.js**: Version 18.18 or higher is recommended. You can check your current version by running:
	`node -v`

## Features
- **Interactive UI** built with [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) for quick styling.
- **Smooth animations** and transitions using Framer Motion.
- **TypeScript** for type safety and better maintainability.
- **Modular sections**: Home, Services, Resume, Work, and Contact.

## Deployment
This portfolio is deployed on [Vercel](https://vercel.com/). If youâ€™d like to deploy your own copy:

1. Sign up for a Vercel account and link your GitHub repository.
2. After pushing your code to GitHub, Vercel will automatically detect the Next.js application and deploy it.
3. Further configuration (like environment variables) can be done in your Vercel project settings.
